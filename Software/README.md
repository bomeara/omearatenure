Software
============

This has a static snapshot of code for software developed as part of my research effort.

I would advise going to the relevant repository for this software to get the most recent version; this static snapshot is just for the convenience of those evaluating my research output.

* BMhyd: Comparative methods on a network. Work done with Tony Jhwueng; package available on CRAN, manuscript (Sept 2014) being rewritten for resubmission to Systematic Biology.
* Brownie: Trait evolution and species delimitation. The trait evolution part has been supplanted by later work in OUwie and corHMM; the species delimitation work is still in Brownie.
* OUwie: Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models for trait evolution (published work).
* RBrownie: An R interface to Brownie (published work).
* Reol: An R interface to the Encylopedia of Life (published work).
* TreEvo: Approximate Bayesian Computation for comparative methods.
* corHMM: Hidden Markov models for trait evolution (published work).
* datelife: An open alternative to TimeTree, work flowing from the phylotastic hackathons.
* lampyr: Teaching app for biodiversity.
* phrapl: phylogeographic inference using approximate likelihoods.
* selac: Population genetics based models for amino acid and codon evolution.
