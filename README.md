============

This repository holds public information I am creating for my tenure packet. Hopefully this will be a useful example for others; if not, at least a cautionary tale. You can see a more natural description of what I do at http://www.brianomeara.info . Note that this is being actively updated: while my research statement is fairly up to date, for example, my teaching statement does not yet incorporate information from Fall and Spring 2014.
